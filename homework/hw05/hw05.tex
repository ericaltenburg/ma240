\question{1}{Prove that, given any two real numbers $x$ and $y$ such that $x < y$, there exists an irrational number $z$ such that $x < z < y$.}

\begin{proof}
	(Contradiction) Let $(x,y)$ be a set where $x,y \in \R$ and $x < y$. Note that this set is infinitely uncountable due to Cantor's Diagonal Argument.\\ 
	Assume there does not exist an irrational number $z \in (x,y)$ such that $x < z < y$. Since no irrational numbers exist in $(x,y)$, then there must only be rational numbers in $(x,y)$ making $(x,y)$ a subset of $\Q$. Because we know that $\Q$ is countable, this means any subsets are also countable, including $(x,y)$. This is a contradiction because it was previously stated that $(x,y)$ is uncountable. Therefore, there must exist an irrational number $z \in (x,y)$ such that $x < z < y$.
\end{proof}
	% Let $z$ be a real number equally distant from $x$ and $y$, $z = \frac{x+y}{2}$. To show that $x<z$, substitute $z$ for $\frac{x+y}{2}$, and
	% \begin{align*}
	% 	x &< z\\
	% 	x &< \frac{x+y}{2}\\
	% 	2x &< x+y\\
	% 	x &< y.
	% \end{align*} 
	% Given that $x<y$, this proves the inequality to be true for $x<z$. To show that $z<y$, substitute $z$ for $\frac{x+y}{2}$ again, and 
	% \begin{align*}
	% 	z &< y\\
	% 	\frac{x+y}{2} &< y\\
	% 	x + y &< 2y\\
	% 	x &< y.
	% \end{align*}
	% Once again, given $x<y$ this proves the inequality to be true for $z<y$.

\question{2}{Let $S\subset\{1,2,\ldots,1000\}$ be a set of 100 natural numbers. Prove that there exists distinct nonempty subsets $X,Y \subset S$ such that the sum of the elements of $X$ equals the sum of the elements of $Y$.}

\begin{proof}
	The number of subsets of 100 natural numbers is $2^{100}$, and the largest possible sum of a subset of numbers of $S$ is $901 + 902 + \ldots + 999 + 1000 = 95050$. This means there are 95050 possible sums of numbers, and due to the Pigeonhole Principle, since there are more subsets ($2^{100}$) than there are possible sums (95050), there exists at least one sum which can be made from two subsets. 
\end{proof}

% Let $A$ and $B$ be the two subsets that form the same sum, and let $C = A \cap B$ which are all the elements that are found in both $A$ and $B$. If we remove the set of $C$ from $A$ and $B$, then $A' = A - C$ and $B' = B-C$. Since we removed the same elements from both sets, the sum of $A'$ and $B'$ will remain the same while being distinct and non-empty. 

\question{3}{Make a conjecture about which numbers $n \in \N$ can be expressed as a sum of two or more consecutive natural numbers. (Note that the numbers int he sum don't have to start at 1. For example, 12 is such a number since $12 = 3 + 4 + 5$.) Then prove your conjecture.}

\begin{conjecture}
	% Every number $n \in \N$ where $n \ne 2^k$ and $k \in \N$ can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive natural numbers.
	Every number $n \in \N$ can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive natural numbers if and only if $n \ne 2^k$ where $k \in \N$.
\end{conjecture}

\begin{proof}
	$(\Longrightarrow)$\\
	(Contradiction) Assume a number $n=2^k$ where $k \in \N$ and can be written as a sum of two or more consecutive natural numbers. The amount of numbers that can be added up to make $n$ can be an odd or even amount.

	Case 1: The summation has an odd amount of consecutive numbers.\\
	A sum of consecutive numbers having an odd amount of numbers would have one exact middle number being added together (i.e. $m + (m+1) + \ldots + (m+n)$ will have an element that is equally distant from $m$ and $(m+n)$, this is known as the average of the two numbers). Then the sum can be expressed as,
	\begin{align*}
	 	\text{sum} &= (\text{average}) \cdot (\text{amount of consecutive number added together}),
	 \end{align*}
	the latter of which is odd. This would mean the sum has an odd number as a factor, however, $2^k$ where $k \in \N$ will always be even which is a contradiction.

	Case 2: The summation has an even amount of consecutive numbers.\\
	Because the sum will have an even amount of consecutive numbers, there will not be a number that is the average like with Case 1, instead the middle two numbers must be summed and then divided by 2. This means the sum can be expressed as,
	\begin{align*}
	 	\text{sum} &= (\text{middle two numbers summed}) \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot (\text{amount of consecutive numbers}).
 	\end{align*}
	We know $(\text{amount of consecutive numbers}) \cdot \frac{1}{2}$ will still be an even number, however, two consecutive numbers added together will always form an odd number. This means the sum has an odd number as a factor, and since $2^k$ where $k \in \N$ will always be even, this is a contradiction.\\

	$(\Longleftarrow)$\\
	(Induction) Suppose $n = 2^k$ where $k \in \N$ cannot be written as the sum of two or more consecutive natural numbers.\\
	Base Case: $k=1$\\
	$n = 2^1 = 2$. This cannot be written as a sum of two or more consecutive natural numbers.\\
	Inductive Hypothesis:\\
	Assume that for $n=2^k$, it cannot be written as the sum of two or more consecutive natural numbers. We wish to prove that the property holds for $k+1$ as well, we observe that
	\begin{align*}
		n &= 2^{k+1}\\
		&= 2^k \cdot 2^1.
	\end{align*}
	With the base case showing that $2^1$ cannot be written as a sum of two or more consecutive natural numbers, and the inductive hypothesis shows that neither can $2^k$, then it follows that the product $(2^1 \cdot 2^k)$ also cannot be written as a sum of two or more consecutive natural numbers. This establishes the claim and completes the proof.
\end{proof}
% We know the sum of numbers from 1 to $n$ is $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, so the summation of numbers from $k$ to $n$ is
