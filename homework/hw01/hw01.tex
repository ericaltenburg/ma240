%=======================02-713 LaTeX template, following the 15-210 template==================
%
% You don't need to use LaTeX or this template, but you must turn your homework in as
% a typeset PDF somehow.
%
% How to use:
%    1. Update your information in section "A" below
%    2. Write your answers in section "B" below. Precede answers for all 
%       parts of a question with the command "\question{n}{desc}" where n is
%       the question number and "desc" is a short, one-line description of 
%       the problem. There is no need to restate the problem.
%    3. If a question has multiple parts, precede the answer to part x with the
%       command "\part{x}".
%    4. If a problem asks you to design an algorithm, use the commands
%       \algorithm, \correctness, \runtime to precede your discussion of the 
%       description of the algorithm, its correctness, and its running time, respectively.
%    5. You can include graphics by using the command \includegraphics{FILENAME}

\question{1}{Write a proof for the following theorem:}

\begin{theorem}
	For any natural number $n$, the number $n^2-n$ is even.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Case 1: Let $n$ be an even natural number.

	Because $n$ is even, it can be written as $n=2k$ where $k \in \N$. Then:

	\begin{align*}
		n^2-n &= (2k)^2-(2k)\\
		&= 4k^2-2k\\
		&= 2(2k^2-k)
	\end{align*}

	This is the definition of an even number.

	Case 2: Let $n$ be an odd natural number.

	Because $n$ is odd, it can be rewritten as $n=2k+1$ where $k \in \N$. Then:

	\begin{align*}
		n^2-n &= (2k+1)^2 - (2k+1)\\
		&= 4k^2 + 4k + 1 - 2k -1\\
		&= 4k^2 + 2k\\
		&= 2(2k^2+k)
	\end{align*}

	This is the definition of an even number.

	Since these two cases cover all possible values of $n$, it follows that $n^2-n$ always results to being even.
\end{proof}
