%=======================02-713 LaTeX template, following the 15-210 template==================
%
% You don't need to use LaTeX or this template, but you must turn your homework in as
% a typeset PDF somehow.
%
% How to use:
%    1. Update your information in section "A" below
%    2. Write your answers in section "B" below. Precede answers for all 
%       parts of a question with the command "\question{n}{desc}" where n is
%       the question number and "desc" is a short, one-line description of 
%       the problem. There is no need to restate the problem.
%    3. If a question has multiple parts, precede the answer to part x with the
%       command "\part{x}".
%    4. If a problem asks you to design an algorithm, use the commands
%       \algorithm, \correctness, \runtime to precede your discussion of the 
%       description of the algorithm, its correctness, and its running time, respectively.
%    5. You can include graphics by using the command \includegraphics{FILENAME}

\question{1}{Write a proof for the following theorem:}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $n \in \Z$. Prove that $2n^2+n$ is odd if and only if $cos(\frac{n \pi}{2})$ is even.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Because of the nature of the \textit{if and only if} it must be proven bidirectionally. First, consider: $2n^2+n$ is odd $\Rightarrow$ $cos(\frac{n \pi}{2})$ is even.

	Case 1: $n$ is odd.

	Let $n=2m+1$ where $m \in \Z$.
	\begin{align*}
		2n^2+n &= 2(2m+1)^2 + (2m+1)\\
		&= 2(4m^2+4m+1) + (2m+1)\\
		&= 8m^2+8m+2+2m+1\\
		&= 8m^2+10m+2+1\\
		&= 2(4m^2+5m+1) + 1
	\end{align*}

	This an odd number by definition.

	Case 2: $n$ is even.

	Let $n=2m$ where $m \in \Z$.
	\begin{align*}
		2n^2+n &= 2(2m)^2 + (2m)\\
		&= 2(4m^2)+2m\\
		&= 8m^2+2m\\
		&= 2(4m^2+m)
	\end{align*}

	This is an even number by definition. Since we want $2n^2+n$ to be odd for this implication, we can see that $n$ must be odd as well. Now let $n = 2m+1$ where $m \in \Z$. Therefore, 

	\begin{align*}
		cos(\frac{n\pi}{2}) &= cos(\frac{(2m+1)\pi}{2})\\
		&= cos(\frac{2m\pi + \pi}{2})\\
		&= cos(m\pi + \frac{\pi}{2})
	\end{align*}

	This evaluates to 0 $\forall$ $m \in \Z$.

	The other direction of the implication that needs to be proven is: $cos(\frac{n\pi}{2})$ is even $\Rightarrow$ $2n^2+n$ is odd. Once again if $cos(\frac{n\pi}{2})$ is even, then it must evaluate to 0 which means $n$ must be odd. And because of case 1 previously shown, it is known that $2n^2+n$ will always be odd as well.
\end{proof}

\question{2}{Write a proof for the following theorem:}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $x,y \in \Z$. Prove that if $xy$ is odd, then $x^2 + y^2$ is even.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Because $xy$ is odd, then $x$ and $y$ must be odd numbers. To show this, we can break it into cases.

	Case: $x, y$ are both odd.

	Let $x=2m+1$ and $y=2n+1$ where $m,n \in \Z$.
	\begin{align*}
		xy &= (2m+1)(2n+1)\\
		&= 4mn + 2m + 2n + 1\\
		&= 2 (2mn + m + n) + 1
	\end{align*}
	This is the definition of an odd number.

	Case: $x$ is odd and $y$ is even.
	
	Let $x=2m+1$ and $y=2n$ where $m,n \in \Z$.
	\begin{align*}
		xy &= (2m+1)(2n)\\
		&= 2(2mn+n)
	\end{align*}
	This is the definition of an even number.
	
	Case: $x$ is even and $y$ is odd.
	
	Mutatis mutandis for the previous case.
	
	Case: $x,y$ are both even.
	
	Let $x=2m$ and $y=2n$ where $m,n \in \Z$.
	\begin{align*}
		xy &= (2m)(2n)\\
		&= 4mn\\
		&= 2(2mn)
	\end{align*}
	This is the definition of an even number.

	Since it is shown that both $x$ and $y$ must both be odd for $xy$ to be odd, we can define $x=2m+1$ and $2n+1$ where $m, n \in \Z$.

	\begin{align*}
		x^2+y^2 &= (2m+1)^2 + (2n+1)^2\\
		&= (4m^2 + 4m + 1) + (4n^2 + 4n + 1)\\
		&= 4m^2+4n^2+4m+4n+2\\
		&= 2(2m^2+2n^2+2m+2n+1)
	\end{align*}

	This is the definition of an even number.

\end{proof}


\question{3}{Write a proof for the following theorem:}

\begin{theorem}
	Prove that there is a student $S$ in MA 240 for whom the following is true: If $S$ eats a chocolate on Valentine's Day, then \textit{everyone} in MA 240 will eat a chocolate on Valentine's Day.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	(Contrapositive) Let $S$ be the student who eats a chocolate on Valentine's Day and $E$ be everyone eating a chocolate on Valentine's Day. Instead of proving $S\Rightarrow E$, this can be proven by rewriting it as $\lnot E \Rightarrow \lnot S$.

	Case: No one in the class will eat a chocolate on Valentine's Day.

	Since no one in the class will be eating any chocolate on Valentine's Day, then there exists the student $S$ in the class who will not be eating chocolate on Valentine's Day either. This means $\lnot E$ and $\lnot S$ are both true making the implication $\lnot E \Rightarrow \lnot S$ true.

	Case: Everyone in the class will eat a chocolate on Valentine's Day.

	Since everyone in the class will eat a chocolate on Valentine's Day, then there exists the student $S$ in the class who will be eating a chocolate on Valentine's Day. This means $\lnot E$ and $\lnot S$ are both false making the implication $\lnot E \Rightarrow \lnot S$ true.
\end{proof}
